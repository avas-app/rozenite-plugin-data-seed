 * Packages that must have exactly one instance in the bundle.
 *
 * The plugin keeps its own React on disk (a devDependency, for building the
 * panel), and Metro resolves a file's imports starting from that file's own
 * directory and walking up — so the plugin's copy wins and the app ends up with
 * two Reacts. The symptom is every hook throwing
 * "Cannot read property 'useRef' of null".
 *
 * `extraNodeModules` does not fix this: it is only consulted when normal
 * resolution *fails*, and here it succeeds with the wrong copy. Re-resolving
 * from the example root is what actually forces a single instance.
 *
 * `@tanstack/react-query` is on the list defensively. The plugin deliberately
 * has no dependency on it today, but two QueryClients from two copies of the
 * library would fail in a uniquely confusing way here — the panel would show an
 * empty cache while the app rendered data — so it is pinned before it can.
